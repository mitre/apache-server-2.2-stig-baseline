scope."
  desc  "By their very nature, CGI type files permit the anonymous web user to
interact with data and perhaps store data on the web server. In many cases, CGI
scripts exercise system-level control over the serverâ€™s resources. These files
make appealing targets for the malicious user. If these files can be modified
or exploited, the web server can be compromised. These files must be monitored
by a security tool that reports unauthorized changes to these files.

used to accomplish this security task. Example file extensions for files
